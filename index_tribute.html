            <h1> A little about his life </h1>
            Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician of ethnic-German ancestry, now known as an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures.
            <br>
            Semmelweis discovered that the incidence of puerperal fever (also known as "childbed fever") could be drastically cut by the use of hand disinfection in obstetrical clinics.
            <br>
            Puerperal fever was common in mid-19th-century hospitals and often fatal.
            <br>
            Semmelweis proposed the practice of washing hands with chlorinated lime solutions in 1847 while working in Vienna General Hospital's First Obstetrical Clinic, where doctors' wards had three times the mortality of midwives' wards.
            <br>
            He published a book of his findings in Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever.

            <h2> A Timeline of his Life </h2>
            <h3> Born in 1818 </h3>

            Ignaz Semmelweis was born on 1 July 1818 in Tabán, neighbourhood of Buda, Hungary, today part of Budapest.
            <br>
            He was the fifth child out of ten of the prosperous grocer family of József Semmelweis and Teréz Müller.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Theory of cadaverous poisoning</h3>

            ...The breakthrough occurred in 1847, following the death of his good friend Jakob Kolletschka, who had been accidentally poked with a student's scalpel while performing a post mortem examination.
            <br>
            Kolletschka's own autopsy showed a pathology similar to that of the women who were dying from puerperal fever. Semmelweis immediately proposed a connection between cadaveric contamination and puerperal fever.
            <br>
            He concluded that he and the medical students carried "cadaverous particles" on their hands[Note 5] from the autopsy room to the patients they examined in the First Obstetrical Clinic.
            <br>
            This explained why the student midwives in the Second Clinic, who were not engaged in autopsies and had no contact with corpses, saw a much lower mortality rate.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Conflict with established medical opinion</h3>

            Semmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time.
            <br>
            The theory of diseases was highly influenced by ideas of an imbalance of the basic "four humours" in the body, a theory known as dyscrasia, for which the main treatment was bloodlettings.
            <br>
            Medical texts at the time emphasized that each case of disease was unique, the result of a personal imbalance, and the main difficulty of the medical profession was to establish precisely each patient's unique situation, case by case.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Breakdown and death</h3>

            In 1865, János Balassa wrote a document referring Semmelweis to a mental institution. On July 30, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra lured him, under the pretense of visiting one of Hebra's "new Institutes", to a Viennese insane asylum located in Lazarettgasse (Landes-Irren-Anstalt in der Lazarettgasse).
            <br>
            Semmelweis surmised what was happening and tried to leave. He was severely beaten by several guards, secured in a straitjacket, and confined to a darkened cell. Apart from the straitjacket, treatments at the mental institution included dousing with cold water and administering castor oil, a laxative.
            <br>
            He died after two weeks, on August 13, 1865, aged 47, from a gangrenous wound, possibly caused by the beating. The autopsy gave the cause of death as pyemia—blood poisoning.
